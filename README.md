Reflection on Software Design Process

What did you do well in developing this documentation?
-I clearly structured the requirements, constraints, and system architecture.
-I provided a thorough evaluation of operating platforms.
-I implemented design patterns effectively (Singleton, Iterator, Composition).

What about the process was helpful when developing the code?
-Defining the domain model helped clarify class responsibilities.
-The UML diagram ensured a strong understanding of relationships.

What would you revise in the document?
-I would add more detailed dev requirements to give more detailed specifics.

How did you interpret the userâ€™s needs and implement them?
-The game needs multi-team support, so I structured teams and players properly.
-To handle real-time updates, I optimized data storage and caching.
-To ensure secure web access, I integrated encryption and authentication.

Why is user-centered design important?
-A good user experience ensures engagement and usability.
-Security measures protect user data from breaches.
-Scalability allows the game to grow with demand.

Future Strategies for Software Design
-Use Agile development for incremental updates.
-Continue refining security protocols to adapt to emerging threats.
